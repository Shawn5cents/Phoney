## üîç Core Components

### 1. Call Handler
- Location: `/app/api/incoming-call`
- Handles incoming Twilio webhooks
- Initiates call flow with TwiML
- Notifies dashboard via Pusher

### 2. Speech Processor
- Location: `/app/api/process-speech`
- Processes speech from Twilio
- Streams to Google Gemini for AI responses
- Generates voice using Google TTS

### 3. No-Input Handler
- Location: `/app/api/no-input`
- Handles cases when no speech is detected
- Provides follow-up prompts
- Ensures smooth conversation flow

### 4. Call Transfer
- Location: `/app/api/transfer-call`
- Enables call transfers to other numbers
- Uses Twilio's TwiML for call control
- Updates call status in real-time

## üîÑ Data Flow

1. **Call Initiation**
   ```
   User Call -> Twilio -> incoming-call API -> Pusher Channels -> Dashboard
   ```

2. **Speech Processing**
   ```
   Twilio Speech Recognition -> process-speech API -> Gemini AI -> Google TTS -> Twilio Response
   ```

3. **Real-time Updates**
   ```
   Call Events -> Pusher Channels -> Dashboard -> Partial Response Updates
   ```

4. **Call Transfer**
   ```
   Dashboard Action -> transfer-call API -> Twilio TwiML -> Call Transfer
   ```

## üè¢ Tech Stack Details

### Frontend
- Next.js 14
- React 18
- Tailwind CSS
- TypeScript
- Pusher.js Client with WebSockets

### Backend
- Next.js API Routes
- Google Gemini AI
- Google Text-to-Speech
- Twilio SDK with TwiML
- Pusher Server for real-time updates

## üì¶ State Management

- Call state managed through Pusher channels
- Channel-based subscriptions (`calls` and `call-${callId}`)
- Real-time state synchronization
- Dashboard state persistence with React

## üîí Security

- API Authentication
- Rate Limiting
- Input Validation
- Secure Webhooks
- Encrypted Storage

## üîå Integration Points

1. **Twilio Integration**
   - Webhook Configuration (/api/incoming-call)
   - Speech Recognition (gather verb)
   - TwiML for Call Control
   - Call Transfers

2. **Google Gemini Integration**
   - Streaming AI Responses
   - Multiple AI Personalities
   - Context Management
   - Response Optimization

3. **Google TTS Integration**
   - Voice Generation
   - Voice Selection by Personality
   - Audio Streaming to Twilio
   - Voice Customization

4. **Pusher Integration**
   - Channel Authentication
